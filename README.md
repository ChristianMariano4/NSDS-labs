# Networked Software for Distributed Systems

This repository contains six projects developed for the *Networked Software for Distributed Systems* course, part of the Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The course explores concepts and technologies for building distributed systems, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and real-time processing. The projects were graded with the highest score: **30/30**.

## Projects Overview

1. **Spark Project**  
   **Topic**: Distributed data processing  
   **Technologies**: Apache Spark, Java
   **Description**: Analyzes web access logs to find popular pages and compute user visits and streaming access counts.

2. **Kafka Project**  
   **Topic**: Real-time stream processing  
   **Technologies**: Apache Kafka, Java  
   **Description**: Implements two consumers to compute the sum of messages in tumbling windows, one for all messages and one per key.

3. **Node-RED Project**  
   **Topic**: Flow-based programming for IoT  
   **Technologies**: Node-RED, JavaScript  
   **Description**: Implements a flow to monitor and check the coherence of temperature data from OpenWeatherMap and sensor data using MQTT.

4. **Akka Project**  
   **Topic**: Reactive distributed systems  
   **Technologies**: Akka, Java  
   **Description**: Simulates a "keep away" ball game using actors, where players pass the ball, track passes, and rest when reaching a threshold.

5. **MPI Project**  
   **Topic**: Parallel computing  
   **Technologies**: MPI (Message Passing Interface), C  
   **Description**: Simulates temperature dynamics in a one-dimensional domain using MPI, with parallel computation and boundary conditions.

6. **Contiki-NG Project**  
   **Topic**: IoT and embedded systems  
   **Technologies**: Contiki-NG, C
   **Description**: Implements a simple RPL network monitor to track and update the status of UDP clients and their parents in a dynamic RPL tree.
